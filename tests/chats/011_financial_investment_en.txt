I'm a complete beginner in investing. Is it better to buy individual stocks or ETFs?

assistant:
For a beginner, ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are generally considered a safer starting point.

user:
Why is that?

assistant:
An individual stock represents ownership in a single company, which is concentrated risk. An ETF, on the other hand, holds a basket of many stocks (like the S&P 500), so your investment is automatically diversified. This diversification significantly reduces the risk of one company's poor performance wiping out your investment.
