Hi, my laptop's fan is suddenly making a loud whirring noise and the chassis feels very hot. What should I do?

assistant:
I recommend checking if the ventilation ports are blocked by dust. You should also open the Task Manager to see if a specific application is causing a CPU spike.

user:
Okay, I see a process called `analytics.exe` that's using 90% of my CPU.

assistant:
That could be the issue. Try to end that process. If the problem persists after a restart, I suggest running a full system scan with your antivirus software, as it could be malware.
